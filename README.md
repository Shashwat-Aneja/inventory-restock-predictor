# Inventory Restock Predictor AI

A machine learning tool that predicts when inventory levels will reach a restocking threshold using historical sales or usage data.  
This project demonstrates predictive analytics to support operational decision-making in business management.

## 📊 Features
- Predicts future inventory level using Linear Regression
- Flags restocking risk when the next-day forecast falls below the configured threshold
- Identifies low-inventory risk
- Reads data from CSV file
